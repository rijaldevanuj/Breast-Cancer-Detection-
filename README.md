# Breast-Cancer-Detection-

a machine learning model to predict breast cancer diagnosis using a dataset of tumor characteristics. Employed Python with Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn to preprocess data, handling missing values by filling with zeros and verifying data integrity. Applied Logistic Regression for binary classification of malignant or benign tumors, achieving an accuracy of 62.28% on the test set. The project showcases skills in data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, with applications in medical diagnostics and healthcare analytics.
